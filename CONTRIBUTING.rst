  are welcome :)

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `serveliza` for local development.

1. Fork the `serveliza` repo on GitHub.
2. Install system requirements to use `pdftotext <https://github.com/jalan/pdftotext>`::

    $ sudo apt install build-essential libpoppler-cpp-dev pkg-config python3-dev

3. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/serveliza.git

4. Create a virtualenv in to your local copy. Assuming you have python3-venv installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ cd serveliza/
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
    $ python setup.py develop
    $ cd docs ; make html ; cd ..

5. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

6. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the
   tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ tox

7. If you made changes that affect the documentation, it is necessary to update 
   the pot files for internationalization::

    $ cd docs/
    $ make gettext
    $ sphinx-intl update -p _build/gettext/ -l es

8. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

9. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8, and for PyPy. Check
   https://travis-ci.com/chivke/serveliza/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

    $ python -m unittest tests.test_roll

Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in HISTORY.rst).
Then run::

$ bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
$ git push
$ git push --tags

Travis will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.
